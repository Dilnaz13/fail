            <p> It tells the story of a troubled man incapable of revealing his true self to others, 
            and who, instead, maintains a façade of hollow jocularity, later turning to a life of alcoholism and drug abuse 
            before his final disappearance. The original title translates as "Disqualified as a human being" or "A failed human".</p>

            <p> Kitchen is an enchantingly original book that juxtaposes two tales about mothers, love, 
            tragedy, and the power of the kitchen and home in the lives of a pair of free-spirited young women
            in contemporary Japan. Mikage, the heroine, is an orphan raised by her grandmother, who has passed away. </p>
