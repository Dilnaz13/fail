            <p>The issue with Ardan and Tomiris can rightfully be called the most good-natured of the issues of Zamandas. 
            Ardan has been blind since birth, but this does not prevent him from achieving his goals in life. 
            For example, he is building a professional career in goalball, runs a successful blog on TikTok and Instagram, and is married to a dazzlingly beautiful girl, as he calls her.</p>
